# LLM Cost Drift Observatory

A governance-oriented observability system that measures how large language models behave over time in production, with a focus on **cost drift**, **response variance**, and **embedding stability** across model versions, prompts, and deployments.

Most teams treat LLMs as opaque APIs. This project treats them as evolving systems that require measurement, baselines, and post-hoc explainability.

---

## Problem Statement

LLMs introduce operational risks that traditional monitoring systems do not capture. While teams may notice rising costs or perceived quality changes, they often lack the ability to answer foundational questions:

* Why did token usage increase for this specific feature or endpoint?
* Is cost growth driven by traffic, prompt changes, or model behavior?
* Did a model or version change alter response semantics?
* Are embeddings still stable enough for downstream systems such as search or RAG?
* Which deviations are expected variance, and which indicate regressions?

Without systematic measurement, these questions are answered heuristically or not at all.

This project exists to make LLM behavior **measurable, explainable, and auditable** over time.

---

## Project Goals

* Capture token-level usage signals per request, model, endpoint, and environment
* Attribute LLM spend to product features, teams, and experiments
* Measure response similarity and semantic drift longitudinally
* Monitor embedding stability across model, prompt, and version changes
* Establish statistical baselines for cost and quality signals
* Surface deviations with evidence-backed, human-readable explanations

> **Note**
> This is not an LLM evaluation benchmark.
> It is an **operational observability and governance system**.

## Design Principles

**Explainability first**
Every metric, alert, or diagnosis must be traceable to concrete measurements and historical context.

**Signals before interpretation**
Low-level usage and embedding signals are captured and preserved before higher-level reasoning is applied.

**Governance by default**
The system is designed for auditability, cost accountability, and post-incident analysis.

**Conservative deviation detection**
Drift is treated as an observation, not a failure. Alerts emphasize confidence, magnitude, and context.

**Provider neutrality**
No assumptions are made about vendor internals or undocumented behavior.
